# jsspInstancesAndResults

A repository with a data set including instances and results from literature.
While the raw data is provided as text files, it is also compiled in an `R` package with an API around it.
The goal is to have an up-date-able archive of the state-of-the-art results, directly linked with BibTeX entries and the functionality to generate result tables and to compare algorithms with said state-of-the-art.

While all data is easily accessible within the `R` package, you can also access the raw data as follows:

- the [results from the literature](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thomasWeise/jsspInstancesAndResults/master/data-raw/results/all_results.txt) as CSV file
- the [instance information file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thomasWeise/jsspInstancesAndResults/master/data-raw/instances/instances.txt) as CSV file, mainly with infos from Jelke Jeroen van&nbsp;Hoorn's website <http://jobshop.jjvh.nl>
- the [instances from ORLib](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thomasWeise/jsspInstancesAndResults/master/data-raw/instances/instance_data_orlib.txt)
- the [raw BibTeX file with all references to literature](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thomasWeise/jsspInstancesAndResults/master/data-raw/bibliography/bibliography.bib)

Many of the information about the problem instances are taken from incredibly great website <http://jobshop.jjvh.nl> run by Jelke Jeroen van&nbsp;Hoorn, while the results are taken from their individual publications.
