# jsspInstancesAndResults

A repository with a data set including instances and results from literature.
While the raw data is provided as text files, it is also compiled in an `R` package with an API around it.
The goal is to have an up-date-able archive of the state-of-the-art results, directly linked with BibTeX entries and the functionality to generate result tables and to compare algorithms with said state-of-the-art.

Many of the information about the problem instances are taken from incredibly great website <http://jobshop.jjvh.nl> run by Jelke Jeroen van&nbsp;Hoorn, while the results are taken from their individual publications.
