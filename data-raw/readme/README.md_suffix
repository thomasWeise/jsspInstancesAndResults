## Repository Structure

In the folder `data-raw`, we provide the `R` scripts used to generate the data frames in the package, the complete data CSV files, and this README.
The idea is that we maintain a central [BibTeX](data-raw/bibliography/bibliography.bib) file and a [list of algorithms](data-raw/results/algorithms.txt) as well as a [list of basic instance information](data-raw/instances/instances.txt).
For each algorithm, a CSV text file is included with the results of that algorithm in the corresponding publication.
The scripts then merge all this information into one [central CSV file with all the results](data-raw/results/all_results.txt).
From these results, we then automatically update the instance information and obtain an [instance information file with best-known solutions](data-raw/instances/instances_with_bks.txt).
This is then used together with the bibliography to build our `README.md`.
This structure allows us to easily update the repository with new results, while providing the full table of all data from literature.
All the data is provided as data frames if you install this repository as `R` package (see before), which will provide `jssp.bibliography`, `jssp.results`, and `jssp.instances`.

## Other Useful Resources

### Overviews of Results

Besides our repository, the following sources in the web provide useful information about the state-of-the-art on the JSSP:

- Many of the information about the problem instances are taken from incredibly great website <http://jobshop.jjvh.nl> run by Jelke Jeroen van&nbsp;Hoorn, while the results are taken from their individual publications.
- The websites <http://optimizizer.com/jobshop.php> run by Oleg V. Shylo, which holds many results on the JSSP as well.
- Ã‰rick Taillard's page <http://mistic.heig-vd.ch/taillard/problemes.dir/ordonnancement.dir/ordonnancement.html>

### Benchmark Instances
