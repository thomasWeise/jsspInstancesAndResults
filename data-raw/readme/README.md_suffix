## Repository Structure

In the folder `data-raw`, we provide the `R` scripts used to generate the data frames in the package, the complete data CSV files, and this README.
The idea is that we maintain a central [BibTeX](data-raw/bibliography/bibliography.bib) file (reflected in data frame `jssp.bibliography`) and a [list of algorithms](data-raw/results/algorithms.txt) as well as a [list of basic instance information](data-raw/instances/instances.txt).
For each algorithm, a CSV text file is included with the results of that algorithm in the corresponding publication.
The scripts then merge all this information into one [central CSV file with all the results](data-raw/results/all_results.txt) and provide the data as data frame `jssp.results`.
From these results, we then automatically update the instance information and obtain an [instance information file with best-known solutions](data-raw/instances/instances_with_bks.txt), reflected in data frame `jssp.instances`.
This is then used together with the bibliography to build our `README.md`.
This structure allows us to easily update the repository with new results, while providing the full table of all data from literature.
Finally, we generate a single, [OR-Library compatible file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thomasWeise/jsspInstancesAndResults/master/data-raw/instance-data/instance_data.txt) with all of the JSSP instances in this study, such that you can easily load them and do your own experiments.
The data from this file is provided as the list `jssp.instance.data` in the `R` package.
In summary, all the data is provided both as text files for processing with arbitary tools and as as data frames/lists `jssp.bibliography`, `jssp.results`, `jssp.instances`, and `jssp.instance.data` if you install this repository as `R` package (see above).

## Additional Functionality in the `R` Package

In the package `jsspInstancesAndResults`, we additionally provide the functionality to transform different representations for candidate solutions into Gantt charts (which are directly checked and evaluated in the process).
Existing Gantt charts can also be evaluated, i.e., we can check whether the Gantt chart is correct and compute its makespan.
If the [plotteR](https://github.com/thomasWeise/plotteR) package is installed, then the Gantt charts can directly be plotted.

```R
data.oo <- c( 2L,  8L, 10L, 12L,  7L, 20L, 18L,   1L,  6L, 11L,
             17L,  9L, 28L,  5L, 30L, 19L, 21L,  38L, 22L,  3L,
             40L, 15L, 48L, 13L, 31L, 27L, 37L,  16L, 58L, 41L,
             50L, 32L, 25L, 23L, 47L,  4L, 68L,  60L, 29L, 39L,
             51L, 26L, 42L, 35L, 33L, 49L, 57L,  70L, 36L, 45L,
             61L, 14L, 55L, 67L, 78L, 43L, 71L,  53L, 52L, 80L,
             59L, 63L, 24L, 81L, 46L, 90L, 62L, 100L, 73L, 65L,
             88L, 56L, 72L, 77L, 34L, 87L, 44L,  98L, 69L, 66L,
             75L, 79L, 54L, 83L, 89L, 82L, 76L,  64L, 91L, 74L,
             99L, 93L, 92L, 86L, 84L, 85L, 96L,  95L, 97L, 94L);
result <- jssp.oo.to.gantt(data.oo, "orb07");
print(result$makespan);
# [1] 397
plotteR::plot.gantt(result$gantt);
```

## Other Useful Resources

Many of the data in this package are gathered from different sources in the internet, which were our starting point to explore and add results from quite a few publications.

### Overviews of Results

Besides our repository, the following sources in the web provide useful information about the state-of-the-art on the JSSP:

- Many of the information about the problem instances are taken from incredibly great website <http://jobshop.jjvh.nl> run by Jelke Jeroen van&nbsp;Hoorn, while the results are taken from their individual publications.
- The websites <http://optimizizer.com/jobshop.php> run by Oleg V. Shylo, which holds many results on the JSSP as well.
- Éric Taillard's Page <http://mistic.heig-vd.ch/taillard/problemes.dir/ordonnancement.dir/ordonnancement.html>

### Benchmark Instances

- [OR-Library](http://people.brunel.ac.uk/~mastjjb/jeb/orlib/jobshopinfo.html) with the `abz*`, `la*`, `orb*`, `swv*`, and `yn*` instances
- Oleg V. Shylo's website (http://optimizizer.com/DMU.php) with the `dmu*` instances
- Éric Taillard's Page <http://mistic.heig-vd.ch/taillard/problemes.dir/ordonnancement.dir/ordonnancement.html> with the `ta*` instances
- A repository with instances of the JSSP can be found at <http://github.com/tamy0612/JSPLIB>.
